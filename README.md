## 📘 Project Overview

This project serves as a gentle introduction to Python—one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages. You will learn what Python is, how it works, and how to write your first scripts using variables, arithmetic operations, and user input.

The goal is to build a solid foundation before moving into more complex programming concepts.



## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

* Understand Python as a high-level programming language.
* Identify major areas where Python is used (web, data, AI, scripting, etc.).
* Install and configure a Python development environment.
* Explain why indentation matters in Python.
* Write basic Python code using variables and expressions.
* Work with user input and simple arithmetic operations.

## **1. Simple Interest Calculator**

**File:** `simple_interest.py`
**Score:** 100%

Compute simple interest using the formula:
`Interest = Principal × Rate × Time`

**Expected Output:**

```
The simple interest is: 150.0
```

## **2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle**

**File:** `rectangle_area.py`
**Score:** 100%

Uses:
`Area = length × width`

**Expected Output:**

```
The area of the rectangle is: 50
```

---

## **3. Convert Hours to Seconds**

**File:** `hours_to_seconds.py`
**Score:** 100%

Convert hours to seconds:
`seconds = hours × 3600`

**Expected Output:**

```
2 hour(s) is 7200 seconds.
```

---

## **4. User Input Age Calculator**

**File:** `future_age_calculator.py`
**Score:** 100%

✔️ Ask user's age
✔️ Assume current year is 2023
✔️ Calculate age in 2050 (add 27 years)

**Example Output:**

```
In 2050, you will be 57 years old.
```

---

## **5. Personal Finance Calculator (Advanced)**

**File:** `finance_calculator.py`
**Score:** 100%

✔️ Take income and expenses
✔️ Calculate monthly savings
✔️ Project annual savings with 5% interest

**Example Interaction:**

```
Enter your monthly income: 5000
Enter your total monthly expenses: 4000
Your monthly savings are $1000.
Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: $12600.
```
